// A closure is a feature in JavaScript where an inner function has access to the outer (enclosing) function's variablesâ€”even after the outer function has finished executing.

// !How it works:

// When a function is created inside another function, the inner function forms a closure. This closure includes the inner function's own scope, the scope of the outer function, and the global scope.
// Because of this, the inner function can access variables declared in the outer function, even after the outer function has returned.
  

function outerFunction() {
    let outerVariable = 'I am from outerFunction';

    function innerFunction() {
        console.log(outerVariable);
    }

    return innerFunction; //if here we will not return the innerFunction and line excuted just below  then due to lexical scope we can access outerVariable  in innerFunction.

   // innerFunction();// 
  //!  The lexical environment is created when a function is called and destroyed when the function returns.
}

const myClosure = outerFunction();
myClosure(); // Output: 'I am from outerFunction'

// !Use Cases:
// ?Encapsulation: Closures are often used to create private variables or functions that cannot be accessed from outside the function.

//?Callbacks and Event Handlers: Closures are commonly used in asynchronous code, such as callbacks or event handlers, where the callback function retains access to variables from its containing function.
