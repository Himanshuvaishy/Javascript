  Q-1 What is the event loop in JavaScript, and how does it work? Can you explain with an example?

  Event Loop in JavaScript

The event loop is a crucial part of JavaScript's concurrency model, enabling the language to perform non-blocking, asynchronous operations while still being single-threaded. 
Here's how it works:

Call Stack:

The call stack is where your code is executed. JavaScript functions get pushed onto the stack when invoked and are popped off once they finish executing.
The call stack is responsible for keeping track of where the code is during execution.
Web APIs (or Browser APIs):

These are provided by the browser and include things like setTimeout, DOM events, HTTP requests (AJAX/fetch), etc.
When you make an asynchronous call, such as setTimeout or fetch, the callback is handed off to the browser's Web APIs.
Callback Queue (or Task Queue):

Once the asynchronous operation is completed, its callback is placed in the callback queue (also known as the task queue).
This queue is a list of callbacks waiting to be executed.
Event Loop:

The event loop continuously checks if the call stack is empty. If it is, it checks the callback queue.
If there are callbacks in the queue and the call stack is empty, the event loop pushes the first callback from the queue onto the call stack to be executed.
Example to Illustrate the Event Loop
Let's look at a simple example:

javascript
Copy code
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Timeout callback");
}, 0);

console.log("End");
Step-by-Step Execution:

Call Stack:

The first console.log("Start") is executed, and "Start" is printed.
Next, setTimeout is called, but it's asynchronous, so its callback is sent to the Web API, not the call stack.
Finally, console.log("End") is executed, and "End" is printed.
Web API:

The setTimeout function is handled by the Web API. The timer (0ms in this case) starts counting down.
Once the timer expires, the callback (() => console.log("Timeout callback")) is moved to the callback queue.
Callback Queue:

The callback from setTimeout is now waiting in the callback queue.
Event Loop:

The event loop checks if the call stack is empty after "End" is printed.
Since the call stack is empty, the event loop takes the callback from the callback queue and pushes it onto the call stack.
Call Stack (Again):

The callback () => console.log("Timeout callback") is now executed, and "Timeout callback" is printed.
Output:

sql
Copy code
Start
End
Timeout callback
Key Points:
Even though setTimeout is set to 0ms, it doesn't mean the callback will execute immediately after the code that schedules it. The callback only runs after the call stack is empty.
This non-blocking behavior is what allows JavaScript to handle multiple tasks concurrently, making it efficient for I/O operations like handling user inputs, network requests, and more.

Let's dive into how the event loop handles microtasks.

Microtasks and the Event Loop
In addition to the callback queue (also known as the macrotask queue), there is another queue called the microtask queue. Microtasks are usually associated with tasks that need to be completed as soon as possible after the currently executing script, without waiting for the next iteration of the event loop.

What are Microtasks?
Microtasks include promises (Promise.then() and Promise.catch()), MutationObserver, and certain other APIs.
Macrotasks include setTimeout, setInterval, setImmediate, I/O callbacks, etc.

Event Loop Execution Order with Microtasks:
Call Stack: Executes the script and functions in the call stack.
Microtask Queue: Once the call stack is empty, before processing any macrotasks, the event loop checks the microtask queue. It executes all the microtasks in the microtask queue until the queue is empty.
Macrotask Queue: After all microtasks are processed, the event loop will check the macrotask queue and process the first macrotask.
Example: Microtasks vs. Macrotasks
javascript
Copy code
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Timeout callback");
}, 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
    console.log("Promise callback");
});

console.log("End");
Step-by-Step Execution:

Call Stack:

The first console.log("Start") is executed, and "Start" is printed.
The setTimeout function is called, its callback is sent to the macrotask queue.
The Promise.resolve().then() creates a microtask that gets added to the microtask queue.
Finally, console.log("End") is executed, and "End" is printed.
Microtask Queue:

The event loop checks the microtask queue as soon as the call stack is empty.
The Promise callback is in the microtask queue and gets executed, so "Promise callback" is printed.
Macrotask Queue:

After all microtasks are processed, the event loop moves on to the macrotask queue.
The setTimeout callback is then executed, printing "Timeout callback".
Output:

sql
Copy code
Start
End
Promise callback
Timeout callback
Key Takeaways:
Microtasks have higher priority than macrotasks and will always be executed before any macrotasks in the same iteration of the event loop.
Promises and other microtasks will always run as soon as the main script and other synchronous code have finished executing, before any setTimeout or similar callbacks.
Why Microtasks Matter:
Understanding microtasks is crucial for:

Optimizing Performance: Microtasks allow for quick updates to the DOM or other tasks that need to happen immediately after the current script without waiting for the next event loop iteration.
Avoiding Race Conditions: Misunderstanding the order in which tasks are executed can lead to bugs, especially when dealing with asynchronous code like promises.
