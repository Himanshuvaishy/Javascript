Q-What is a callback function?

A callback function in JavaScript is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after the completion of that function. Callback functions are often used to handle asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from a server or reading a file, where the code doesn't need to wait for the operation to complete before moving on.

How Callback Functions Work
When you pass a function as an argument to another function, the receiving function can call (or "invoke") the passed-in function at the appropriate time. The function that accepts another function as an argument is often referred to as a "higher-order function."

Example of a Callback Function
Let's look at a basic example:

javascript
Copy code
function greet(name, callback) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
  callback();
}

function sayGoodbye() {
  console.log("Goodbye!");
}

greet("Rohit", sayGoodbye);
Output:

Copy code
Hello, Rohit!
Goodbye!
Explanation:
The greet function takes two arguments: name (a string) and callback (a function).
Inside greet, it first logs a greeting message to the console.
After that, it invokes the callback function, which in this case is sayGoodbye.
When greet is called with "Rohit" and sayGoodbye as arguments, it first prints "Hello, Rohit!" and then calls sayGoodbye, which prints "Goodbye!".
Asynchronous Callbacks
Callbacks are especially useful in asynchronous programming. For instance, when you're working with operations that take time to complete (like fetching data from an API), you can pass a callback function to be executed once the operation is finished.

Here's an example using setTimeout, which simulates a delay:

javascript
Copy code
function fetchData(callback) {
  console.log("Fetching data...");
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Data fetched!");
    callback();
  }, 2000); // Simulates a 2-second delay
}

function processData() {
  console.log("Processing data...");
}

fetchData(processData);
Output:

kotlin
Copy code
Fetching data...
Data fetched!
Processing data...
Explanation:
fetchData is a function that simulates fetching data, which takes 2 seconds (using setTimeout).
After the data is fetched, fetchData calls the callback function, which is processData.
processData then logs "Processing data..." to the console.
Key Points:
Callback functions are used to ensure that a particular block of code is executed only after another block of code has finished executing.
They are commonly used in asynchronous programming (e.g., handling events, reading files, making API calls).
Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments or return them.


Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Callbacks:
Synchronous callbacks: These are executed immediately, in the order they are called (e.g., passing a function to Array.map or Array.forEach).
Asynchronous callbacks: These are executed later, after an asynchronous operation has completed (e.g., passing a function to setTimeout, or handling API responses with fetch).
In summary, a callback function is a powerful concept in JavaScript that allows for more flexible and dynamic programming, especially in managing asynchronous code execution.
